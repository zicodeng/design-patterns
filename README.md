Design patterns are optimized and reusable solutions to common programming problems.

## Why Are They Important?

They are patterns, meaning they are created by experienced developers who have previously encountered these common problems. If we encounter these problems, why do we ever want to recreate a solution when we can take advantages of these already proven solutions?
